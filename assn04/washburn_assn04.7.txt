The relationship betweent the raw score and the database size is that they are the same value for blastn searches, while the bit score is about twice the size of the database for the blastn searches. The E-value score is lower when the database is smaller becuase the E-value determines the number of hits a person can expect to find, therefore a smaller database will have a smaller E-value.
